## Solution Explanation
My choice of technologies are as follows;
  #### React library 
    For the UI
  #### SASS
    For Styling
  #### SASS
    For Icons
  #### Chrome Dev Tools
    For Testing 

For the project, I decided to use regular sass instead of a css framework like Tailwind or Chakra because I wanted to demonstrate my understanding of the basics. I also believe proper mastery of these basics make using any framework easier.
I implemented the interface using scss because it has a few advantages over regular css. For responsiveness, I used media querries to achieve this.
I did my best to follow the design and my results are as shown below;
